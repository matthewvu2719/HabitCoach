Habit Coach – Full Project Specification
1. Overview
The Personal Productivity Coach is a full‑stack application that combines React, Python (FastAPI/Flask), PostgreSQL, Docker, Machine Learning, and a built‑in AI chatbot to help users build, track, and optimize habits. The system intelligently analyzes the user’s time availability, difficulty levels of habits, and long‑term success patterns to provide personalized schedule recommendations.
The project integrates:
Smart habit tracking, recommendation, motivation


ML‑powered time optimization


AI‑based daily/weekly planning assistant


Natural‑language habit entry ("I want to read more" → new habit)


Generate a timetable to follow, can get input timetable from image then build a new timetable based on that


This combination creates a realistic, technically impressive full‑stack ML product.

2. Key Features
2.1 Habit Management
Users can:
Add new habits with natural-language inputs


Provide estimated time and frequency (daily/weekly/custom)


Track completion and view history


Categorize habits automatically via NLP (fitness, learning, social, wellness, productivity)


2.2 AI Habit Coach
The AI coach uses an ML engine + chatbot interface to:
Recommend optimal times for habits based on schedule patterns


Detect when a habit is too difficult or unrealistic


Suggest reducing frequency or modifying habit structure


Identify overloaded schedules and recommend rescheduling


Suggest alternate forms of habits (e.g., message instead of call)


Encourage healthy relationships by integrating social habits


2.3 Scheduling Engine
The system integrates all habits into a cohesive weekly plan by:
Checking for time conflicts


Predicting user availability


Ranking habits by cognitive/emotional load


Adjusting habits when necessary


2.4 Machine Learning Components
NLP Habit Parsing: Converts natural sentences into structured habits.


Difficulty Estimation Model: Estimates likelihood of habit completion.


Personal Time Budget Model: Estimates how much time the user actually has per week.


Adaptive Recommendation Model: Learns over time and adjusts user plans.


2.5 AI Chatbot
Powered by Python and integrated with the ML engine.
Helps users log habits


Suggests improvements


Provides weekly summaries



3. Example User Flow
User Input
"I want to add reading and learning French to my habits."
System Behavior
NLP parses the sentence → identifies two habits.


System asks for frequency and time estimates.


ML categorizes these as learning/cognitive habits.


Scheduler checks available time slots.


Weekly plan updated with optimal times.


Coach checks if time budget is exceeded.


If overloaded → suggests modifying frequency or swapping out another habit.



4. Social & Relationship Habits
Users can add:
Weekly call to family


Weekly check-in with friends


Monthly catch-up sessions


AI Capabilities:
Detects if calls/messages are consistently skipped.


Suggests better timing or reduced commitment.


Tracks emotional impact (optional mood inputs).


Recommends relationship habits if user tends to be happier when doing them.

6. Technical Breakdown
6.1 Machine Learning Models
NLP Habit Parser (spaCy / custom model)
 Extracts:


Habit name


Category


Frequency


Estimated time


Difficulty Estimator


Inputs: time required, load, past success rate


Output: difficulty score (0–1)


Time Budget Predictor


Learns actual free time per week


Predicts user’s realistic capacity


Recommendation Engine


Suggests rescheduling


Detects overloaded periods


Suggests reducing frequency or breaking habits into smaller tasks



7. Key Scenarios
Scenario 1: User Overloaded
User adds:
Reading 1 hour/day


Gym 1 hour/day


French learning 45 min/day


Weekly family call (45 min)


System detects total weekly time exceeds user’s predicted available time.
AI Recommendation:
Reduce French to 3 days/week


Move gym to alternate days


Shift family call to a lower-load day



Scenario 2: User Skips a Habit Multiple Times
If user misses French learning 4 times in a row:
AI recommends lowering difficulty or moving time slot.


Suggests smaller steps (e.g., 10 minutes/day).



Scenario 3: User Adds Relationship Habit
"Add weekly check-in with friends."
System:
Categorizes as social/well-being


Chooses optimal time


Tracks consistency


Detects emotional trends if mood tracking is enabled



7.5 Timetable Generation, Adjustment & External Timetable Import
Real-Time Adjustment Based on Actual Time Spent
The system supports dynamic schedule adjustment when users report how long a task or habit actually took. This enables the AI to keep the timetable realistic, flexible, and personalized.
User Reporting Flow
After completing a habit or event, the app asks:
"How long did this actually take?"


Optional mood/energy rating


Users can also manually report:
"I took 1 hour instead of 45 minutes to do homework."


"Gym took 20 minutes less than scheduled."


AI-Driven Adjustment Logic
When users report deviations in time spent, the system will:
Recalculate remaining free time for the day/week


Shift later tasks forward or backward


Add a buffer (default: +15 minutes) to future time blocks for similar tasks


Learn a personal duration model, improving predictions over time


Overrun Example
Scheduled: French practice — 30 minutes
 Actual: 50 minutes
System actions:
Mark session as 50 minutes


Adjust the next available time block by shifting other tasks later


Detect if any task is pushed into conflict; automatically reschedule


Increase future French session estimates from 30 → ~40 minutes


Add a 15-minute buffer for next time


Underrun Example
Scheduled: Gym — 1 hour
 Actual: 40 minutes
System actions:
Mark actual duration


Free up extra 20 minutes


Suggest: "Do you want to fill this with a small habit?" (e.g., reading for 10 minutes)


Update future gym estimates to ~50 minutes with buffer


Adaptive Duration Learning
The AI learns over time:
Types of tasks you usually underestimate (e.g., assignments)


Tasks you usually finish early (e.g., meditation)


Time-of-day effects (e.g., slower in evenings)


Day-of-week patterns


This personal duration model improves timetable accuracy.

7.6 External Timetable Import
Automatic Timetable Generation
The system can generate a dynamic weekly timetable based on:
User’s fixed commitments (work, classes, meetings)


Available free time windows


Existing habits


AI‑recommended habits or rescheduled items


The generated timetable includes:
Color‑coded categories (learning, fitness, social, wellness, productivity)


Time‑blocked segments


Adaptive rescheduling when conflicts occur


Importing Existing Timetables (PDF / Word / Image)
Users can upload an existing timetable in the form of:
PDF


Microsoft Word (.doc/.docx)


Image (PNG/JPG)


The system performs the following:
Document parsing using OCR + table extraction to detect:


Days of week


Time blocks


Course/work labels


Block durations


Automatic creation of fixed events in the database.


Integration with the scheduling engine to:


Fill unused gaps with habit slots


Ensure no overlap between fixed events and habits


Adjust habit frequency if no free time is available


Smart Timetable Merging
When the user provides a timetable from school/work:
The AI merges it with existing habits


Detects optimal habit placement around classes/meetings


Warns about overloaded days


Regeneration on Changes
When the user adds new habits or changes availability:
The timetable is regenerated automatically


A diff view highlights added, moved, or removed blocks
